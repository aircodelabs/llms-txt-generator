# Project Status

## Current Development Status

âœ… **Core functionality implemented and stable**
- Project has evolved from initialization phase to a fully functional tool
- All major features are implemented and tested
- Build and deployment pipeline optimized
- **Documentation completely updated and enhanced**
- **Project standardization completed** (Latest)
  - Added CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
  - Added MIT LICENSE for open source compliance

## Functional Context

This is a **CLI-only** Node.js tool for generating standardized documentation files for AI models:

1. **`llms.txt`** - Concise navigation view of project structure
2. **`llms-full.txt`** - Comprehensive documentation with full project details

These files follow standardized formats to help AI models better understand project structures and provide more accurate assistance.

**Note**: This tool is designed exclusively for command-line usage and MCP integration. Programmatic API usage has been removed to focus on CLI functionality.

## âœ… Implemented Features

- âœ… Core text generation logic with TypeScript
- âœ… File output processing with customizable paths
- âœ… Configuration parsing and validation
- âœ… Command line interface (CLI)
- âœ… MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
- âœ… Enhanced build process with asset copying
- âœ… TypeScript type definitions
- âœ… File operation utilities

## Recent Major Improvements

### Project Standardization (Latest)
- **Problem**: Missing standard open source project files
- **Solution**: Added essential project documentation files
- **Improvements**:
  - âœ… Created CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
  - âœ… Added MIT LICENSE file for open source compliance
  - âœ… Documented version history and project evolution
  - âœ… Established semantic versioning practices
- **Impact**: Project now follows open source best practices and is ready for public distribution

### Documentation Enhancement
- **Problem**: README contained programmatic usage documentation that was no longer needed
- **Solution**: Streamlined README to focus exclusively on CLI usage and MCP integration
- **Improvements**:
  - âœ… Added emoji icons and better visual hierarchy
  - âœ… Enhanced feature descriptions with clear benefits
  - âœ… Removed programmatic API documentation (CLI-only focus)
  - âœ… Detailed MCP integration guide for multiple AI assistants
  - âœ… Streamlined usage examples focused on CLI
  - âœ… Complete project structure documentation
  - âœ… Contributing guidelines and development workflow
  - âœ… Troubleshooting section with common issues
  - âœ… Fixed CLI command inconsistencies (generate vs llms-txt-generator)
- **Impact**: Clean, focused documentation for CLI tool usage

### Build Process Enhancement
- **Problem**: Prompt template files (`*.md`) were not included in distribution
- **Solution**: Modified build script to automatically copy `src/llm/prompts/*.md` to `dist/llm/prompts/`
- **Impact**: Ensures all necessary assets are available in the built package

### Testing Infrastructure Overhaul
- **Problem**: Integration tests were using mocked file system instead of real files
- **Solution**: Restructured test architecture to separate unit tests (with mocks) and integration tests (with real file system)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Unit tests: Use `jest.mock()` for isolated testing
  - Integration tests: Use `jest.resetModules()` and `jest.unmock()` for real file system access
- **Result**: 13/13 tests passing, proper test isolation achieved

## Technical Architecture

### Core Modules
- **`src/llm/utils.ts`**: Prompt loading and management utilities
- **`src/llm/prompts/`**: Template files for content generation
- **`src/cli/build.ts`**: Command-line interface
- **`src/mcp/server.ts`**: MCP server for AI integration
- **`src/index.ts`**: CLI entry point (no programmatic API)

### Build Pipeline
```bash
pnpm build = tsc + mkdir -p dist/llm/prompts + cp src/llm/prompts/*.md dist/llm/prompts/
```

### Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Mock file system, test logic in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Real file system, test actual file operations
- **Coverage**: Jest with comprehensive reporting

## Current Technical Debt

- âœ… ~~Complete project structure~~ - **RESOLVED**
- âœ… ~~Functional modules~~ - **RESOLVED** 
- âœ… ~~Test environment~~ - **RESOLVED**
- âœ… ~~Project standardization files~~ - **RESOLVED**
- ðŸ”„ Documentation could be expanded with more usage examples
- ðŸ”„ Consider adding more prompt templates for different project types

## Next Potential Enhancements

1. **Multi-language Support**: Add support for generating documentation in different languages
2. **Custom Templates**: Allow users to provide custom prompt templates
3. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom generators
4. **Web Interface**: Optional web UI for non-CLI users
5. **Git Integration**: Automatic detection of project changes for incremental updates
