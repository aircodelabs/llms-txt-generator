# Project Status Memory

## Current Development Status

The project is in the initialization phase and core functionality has not yet been implemented.

## Functional Context

This project aims to generate two types of text files:
1. `llms.txt` - Possibly a simplified version of LLMs list or configuration

These files may be related to website LLMs integration or configuration.

## Features To Be Implemented

- File output processing
- Configuration parsing
- Command line interface

## Technical Debt

- Complete project structure not yet established
