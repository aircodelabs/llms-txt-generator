## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Guidelines and Error Handling

### üîí Mandatory Requirements
- **NEVER** overwrite existing `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` without explicit user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** use relative paths starting with `./` in llms.txt
- **STRICTLY** follow the mandatory format templates provided
- **ENSURE** llms.txt file size remains ‚â§ 2KB
- **VALIDATE** all file paths exist before including them in documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage Priority
**Primary Tools (Use These First):**
- `list_dir` - For directory exploration
- `view_files` - For reading file contents
- `search_by_regex` - For finding specific patterns
- `write_to_file` - For creating output files

**Fallback Tools (If Primary Tools Unavailable):**
- `list_directory` - List directory contents with [FILE] or [DIR] prefixes
- `search_files` - Recursive file search with pattern matching
- `write_file` - Create or overwrite files (use with caution)
- `create_directory` - Create directories as needed

### üö® Error Handling Procedures

#### If README.md is Missing:
- Look for alternative documentation files (README.rst, README.txt, docs/index.md)
- If no main documentation exists, create a basic project description from source code analysis
- **NEVER** proceed without some form of project description

#### If Source Directory is Non-Standard:
- Check for common alternatives: `lib/`, `app/`, `source/`, root-level files
- Adapt the documentation structure to match the actual project layout
- Document the non-standard structure in the output

#### If Project Type is Unclear:
- Examine file extensions and directory patterns
- Look for build files, configuration files, or dependency manifests
- Default to generic project documentation if type cannot be determined

#### If File Access Fails:
- Skip inaccessible files and note the limitation in the final report
- Continue with available files rather than failing completely
- Suggest manual review for missing content
